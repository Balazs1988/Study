## Scheduling

The planned schedule of the days:
* 9-12 Overview of the actual topic
* 12-13 Lunch
* 13-15 Examples, discussion
* 15-17 Work on the exercises, questions, reviews

There will be breaks when needed.

## Uploading the solutions

* Let create a branch from the master branch!
* The branch name format is ``<family name>_<given name>``.
* Create a ``solutions`` directory beside the ``topics``.

The exercises of 1-3 topics can be solved in Jupyter. Therefore, it can be uploaded to the
* ``solutions/1C_Solutions.ipynb``
* ``solutions/2C_Solutions.ipynb``
* ``solutions/3C_Solutions.ipynb``

In general, You can solve the problem in a separate module. In this case You should follow the
* ``solutions/<topic number>/<exercise number>_<meaningful name>.py`` format.
* For instance ``solutions/4/08/date_format.py``.
* When the solution requires a package, the convention is similar, for instance ``solutions/4/03/os_type``.
* NOTE: The leading zero is necessary for natural sorting.
